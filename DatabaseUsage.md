## Using the Database 

**Terminology**
- *context*: is the local scope of the database, so the one the code has access to.

1. Notice two important folders: Data and Migrations

**Data**
This contains all the database related files:
- BaseRepository is what your services need to inherit from to inject the database context into the service. 
- DataContext is the part that runs to create a database context, it is used in Program to connect to the database
	- Essentially give the app access to the database.
	**Models**
    - Definitions for each table

**Migrations**
These are generated by entity framework, they are kinda an intermediate SQL which we can roll back to if anything goes wrong.
- These are commited to the db which creates the tables themselves.

1. Create a Migration 
```bash
dotnet ef migrations add <Name of Migration>
```
2. Commit to DB
```
dotnet ef database update
```
| Note! when you name your migration do it based on what you did, for example `AddSexualityAttribute` or wider `UpdateMoodTable`

**Connections**
Note the connection string in `Program.cs` 
1. You will need to make a new file called `appsettings.Development.json`
2. Once you have this right click it and hover over git and exclude from git.
3. Ask Richard for the connection strings
